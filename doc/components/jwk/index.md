Keys And Key Sets Management
============================

To perform cryptographic operations (signature/verification and encryption/decryption), you will need an algorithm and a key.

# JWK

A JWK object represents a key. It contains all parameters needed by the algorithm and also information parameters.

This framework is able to create private and public keys easily.
It can also generate those keys from external resources.

Now letâ€™s discover the `JWKFactory` object.

## Generate A New Key

The `JWKFactory` can generate random keys. 5 types of keys are supported:

* Symmetric Key:
    * `oct`: octet string
    * `none`: special key type used only with the `none` algorithm
* Asymmetric Key:
    * `RSA`: RSA key pair
    * `EC` : Elliptic Curve key pair
    * `OKP`: Octet key pair

For all asymmetric keys, you will ALWAYS receive a private key. To convert this private key into a public one, you have to use the method `toPublic()`:

```php
<?php

$public_key = $private_key->toPublic();
```

### Octet String

The following example will show you how to create an `oct` key.
Additional parameters will be set to limit the scope of this key (signature/verification only with the `HS256` algorithm).

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createOctKey(
    1024, // Size in bits of the key. We recommend at least 128 bits.
    [
        'alg' => 'HS256', // This key must only be used with the HS256 algorithm
        'use' => 'sig'    // This key is used for signature/verification operations only
    ]
);
```

### RSA Key Pair

The following example will show you how to create a `RSA` key.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$private_key = JWKFactory::createRSAKey(
    4096, // Size in bits of the key. We recommend at least 2048 bits.
    [
        'alg' => 'RSA-OAEP-256', // This key must only be used with the RSA-OAEP-256 algorithm
        'use' => 'enc'    // This key is used for encryption/decryption operations only
    ]);
```

### Elliptic Curve Key Pair

The following example will show you how to create a `EC` key.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createECKey('P-256');
```

The supported curves are:

* `P-256`
* `P-384`
* `P-521` (note that this is **521** and not 512)

### Octet Key Pair

The following example will show you how to create a `OKP` key.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createOKPKey('X25519');
```

The supported curves are:

* `Ed25519` for signature/verification only
* `X25519` for encryption/decryption only

### None Key

The `none` key type is a special type used only for the `none` algorithm.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createNoneKey();
```

## Create Key From External Sources

### From Values

In case you already have key values, you can create a key by passing those values as an argument:

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createFromValues([
    'kid' => '71ee230371d19630bc17fb90ccf20ae632ad8cf8',
    'kty' => 'RSA',
    'alg' => 'RS256',
    'use' => 'sig',
    'n' => 'vnMTRCMvsS04M1yaKR112aB8RxOkWHFixZO68wCRlVLxK4ugckXVD_Ebcq-kms1T2XpoWntVfBuX40r2GvcD9UsTFt_MZlgd1xyGwGV6U_tfQUll5mKxCPjr60h83LXKJ_zmLXIqkV8tAoIg78a5VRWoms_0Bn09DKT3-RBWFjk=',
    'e' => 'AQAB',
]);
```

### From A Key File

You can convert a PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 key file into a JWK.
The following method supports PEM and DER formats. Encrypted keys are also supported.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createFromKeyFile(
    '/path/to/my/key/file.pem', // The filename
    'Secret',                   // Secret if the key is encrypted
    [
        'use' => 'sig',         // Additional parameters
    ]
);
```

### From A PKCS#12 Certificate

You can convert a PKCS#12 Certificate into a JWK.
Encrypted certificates are also supported.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createFromPKCS12CertificateFile(
    '/path/to/my/key/file.p12', // The filename
    'Secret',                   // Secret if the key is encrypted
    [
        'use' => 'sig',         // Additional parameters
    ]
);
```

### From A X.509 Certificate

You can convert a X.509 Certificate into a JWK.

```php
<?php

use Jose\Component\KeyManagement\JWKFactory;

$key = JWKFactory::createFromCertificateFile(
    '/path/to/my/key/file.p12', // The filename
    [
        'use' => 'sig',         // Additional parameters
    ]
);
```

*Please note that X.509 certificates only contains public keys*.

# JWKSet

A JWKSet object represents a key set. It can contain several keys.

*We recommend you to avoid mixing public, private or shared keys in the same key set*.

```php
<?php
use Jose\Component\Core\JWKSet;

$jwkset = JWKSet::createFromKeys([
    $jwk1,
    $jwk2,
    $jwk3,
]);
```

The JWKSet object provided by the framework is immutable. This means that any modification of a key set will create a new key set.
When you add a new key or remove an existing one, the method will return you a new object.

```php
<?php

$new_jwkset = $jwkset->with($jwk4);
```

The JWKSet in the variable `$jwkset` is unchanged. The one in the variable `$new_jwkset` contains the new key.
