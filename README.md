This framework provides an implementation of:

* JW**S** [JSON Web Signature (RFC 7515)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515),
* JW**T** [JSON Web Token (RFC 7519)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
* JW**E** [JSON Web Encryption (RFC 7516)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516),
* JW**A** [JSON Web Algorithms (RFC 7518)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
* JW**K** [JSON Web Key (RFC 7517)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).
* JSON Web Key Thumbprint ([RFC 7638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638)).
* Unencoded Payload Option [RFC7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797).

This framework is not just a library, it contains also Symfony bundles for an easy integration into your application.
It also provides a standalone console command that will help you to manager your keys and key sets. 

# Provided Features

## Supported Input Types:

JWS or JWE objects support every input that can be encoded into JSON:

* [x] `string`, `array`, `integer`, `float`...
* [x] Objects that implement the `\JsonSerializable` interface such as `JWKInterface` or `JWKSetInterface`

The [detached content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F) is also supported.

Unencoded payload is supported. This means you can sign and verify payload without base64 encoding operation.
As per the [RFC7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797), the `b64` header MUST be protected.
When `b64` header is set, the `crit` protected header with value `b64` in its array of values is mandatory.

## Supported Serialization Modes

* [x] Compact JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)
* [x] Flattened JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)
* [x] General JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)

## Supported Compression Methods

# The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

# Prerequisites

This framework needs at least:
* ![PHP 7.1+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.1%2B-ff69b4.svg),
* OpenSSL extension.
* GMP extension.
* MBString extension.

Please consider the following optional requirements:
* If you intent to use `EdDSA` or `ECDH-ES` algorithm with `Ed25519`/`X25519` curves on PHP 7.1, please install this [third party extension](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-php)

# Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1` with all algorithms.

Tests vectors from the [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are fully implemented and all tests pass.

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Spomky-Labs/JOSE) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/9123fbfc-7ae1-4d63-9fda-170b8ad794ee).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/22874677).

Code coverage is analyzed by [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/Spomky-Labs/jose).

# Performances

Please read the [performance page](doc/benchmarks/index.md) to know how to test the algorithms of the framework.

You can also see the [last benchmarks](doc/benchmarks/results.md) made with our development environment.

**The use of the Algorithm `ECDH-ES` with curves `P-256`, `P-384` or `P-521` is not recommended**.
